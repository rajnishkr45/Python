## 📚 Chapter 3 – What I Learned

In **Chapter 3**, I studied **Python strings** and explored several commonly used string methods:

- `len()` – Returns the length of a string  
- `replace()` – Replaces a specified part of the string  
- `upper()` – Converts the string to uppercase  
- `lower()` – Converts the string to lowercase  
- `find()` – Finds the first occurrence of a specified value  

Excited to continue learning and building! 🚀
