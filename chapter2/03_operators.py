# Assignmnet operator

x = (
    4 - 2
)  # 4 - 2 is assigned in x using "=" sign so it is called as assignment operator
print(x)

y = 8
# y += 3 # here += is assignment operator it means increase the value of y by 3 and store the new value into y
y -= 3  # here -= is assignment operator it means decrease the value of y by 3 and store the new value into y
print(y)

# Comperision operator

f = (
    5 == 4
)  # here "==" is a comperision operator which compares the value of LHS and RHS

print(f)
